# Chatty

A custom chat application for @mzfr & I written in [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/)

We didn't want to use Telegram etc for random junk we share. We tried [termchat](https://github.com/lemunozm/termchat/) before this, but I wanted something that runs in background & allows us to quickly send data to each other:

* URLs are opened in the browser
* Anything else is copied to the clipboard

## why

We have individual displays/keyboards/mouse but a share CPU. [Aster for Windows](https://www.ibik.ru/) allows us to login with our individual user accounts at the same time.
